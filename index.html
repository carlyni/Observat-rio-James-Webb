                             <p class="descricao" > Principal observatório de ciência espacial do mundo, o James Webb é considerado o sucessor do telescópio espacial Hubble, lançado em 1990. Ambos foram construídos para se observar o chamado Espaço Profundo. A diferença é que o James Webb é capaz de enxergar fenômenos em diferentes frequências do espectro de luz.</p>

The large spiral galaxy at the base of this image is accompanied by a profusion of smaller, more distant galaxies which range from fully-fledged spirals to mere bright smudges. Named LEDA 2046648, it is situated a little over a billion light-years from Earth, in the constellation Hercules. .</p> -->
